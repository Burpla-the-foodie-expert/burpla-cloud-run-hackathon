## Inspiration
Decision fatigue is real—especially for “what do we eat?” moments. Burpla is a friendly agent that listens to the chat, synthesizes a few great options, and turns that into an instant, fair vote so groups decide fast. It balances distance and ETA so no one is stuck with a long drive. Safety (leave‑now reminders and optional “got home” status) is a nice add‑on, not the core.
Fun launch video concept:
- A: “I’m here—how far are you?” (A’s at the restaurant)
- B: “Stuck in traffic, be right there.” (…B is still in bed)
Group stuck deciding? Burpla spins up a quick poll from the chat—three taps later, decision made. After dinner: Burpla pings “Time to head out,” and friends can optionally mark that they got home safely.

## What it does
- Understands chat context and @mentions to activate the agent
- Synthesizes options from conversation + preferences + Places data
- Runs instant polls; records votes; announces winners (the core flow)
- Finds fair meeting spots via midpoint and ETA balancing
- Shares directions and a map view
- Sends leave‑now reminders based on live ETA
- Optional “I’m on my way / got home” status for group safety

## How we built it
- Frontend: responsive React web app (mobile-first) with a split List + Map layout and a compact bottom‑sheet on mobile
- Agent: built with Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK); tools for Places search, Distance Matrix, polling, and reminders
- Models: Gemini via AI Studio for reasoning, summarization, and prompt flows
- Maps data: Google Places API (Text Search) + Distance Matrix for distance/ETA
- Runtime: Google Cloud Run (service), stateless compute with per‑request tool calls
- Data: lightweight group/poll state stored in a managed database (e.g., Firestore) and ephemeral session memory in the agent
- Observability: structured logs for tool calls and latency, basic usage metrics

# Architecture at a glance
- React client → HTTPS → Cloud Run service (API + ADK agent)
- Agent tools:
    - PollOrchestrator → create/vote/close + winner selection (Suggestion → Poll → Winner)
    - PlacesSearchTool → Google Places Text Search
    - DistanceMatrixTool → Google Distance Matrix
    - ReminderScheduler → “leave by” notifications
- Storage: groups, polls, saved places, and user prefs
- Map pane mirrors current results; markers filter with chips like “Open now”, “Rating 4+”
# The “fairness” idea for groups
We balance options by both distance and time:
- Primary objective: minimize group travel variance: 
                                                  min    var(ETAi→p)
                                             p∈places
- Tie‑breakers: rating, open status, and user preferences

## Challenges we ran into
- Designing a poll flow that’s fast, legible, and hard to game
- De‑duping places across queries and keeping results stable for fair voting
- Handling partial permissions (no location, limited history) while remaining helpful
- Cost/latency trade‑offs for multiple tool calls (batching Distance Matrix)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
- Prompt design for tool‑using agents (grounding, guardrails, and concise replies)
- ADK patterns for deterministic tool selection and memory
- Mapping UX: show fewer, better options with immediate affordances (Poll, Map, Directions)
- ETA‑based reminders feel magical when they match reality; clock‑skew and traffic updates matter

## What's next for Burpla
- Richer group presence (calendar holds, reservation notes)
- Preference learning and dietary constraints
- Safer sharing: end‑to‑end opt‑in trip status with auto‑expire
- Deeper multi‑agent workflows (e.g., “just choose for us” with explanations)
- “Deploy to Run” link from AI Studio for reproducible spins
